# Copmarator Widget

## My assumptions

I prefer techologies that are already used in you project.
So I selected:

- TypeScript/JavaScript
- HTML/CSS (Tailwind)
- React (you already have Next, so it not needed for one component)
- Git (with Github)
- Animation library (Motion.dev)

You doesn't have responsive design, and so did I

- width: 700px
- height: 600px

## Note

bottom and top id are switched because of col-reverse
